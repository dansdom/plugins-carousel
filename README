version 1.1 - just a bit of optimisation of the code here, no functional changes
version 1.2 - added new option to start at a nominated position
version 1.3 - added option to declare a css selector for the scroll pane this will enable the HTML structure to be more flexible. If this value is false then HTML structure has to be precise
version 1.4 - modified the extend method to create a new object 'opts' that doesn't destroy the settings object. I will think about creating an 'opts' method so that the settings can be modified outside of the script
version 1.5 - bug fixing and JSLint, optimised code and compacted all function 'var' statements
version 1.6 - added options to have the carousel on a continual rotation (either forward or backward - forward by default) -  I have made it to work only if circular = true
version 1.7 - added functionality to show a representation of the active elements in the carousel
version 1.8 - fixed bug when controlPane is set to false, next/prev button not showing correct postion when control list has been defined. Took out the controlPane option altogether	
			  the javascript runs fine whether its set or not
